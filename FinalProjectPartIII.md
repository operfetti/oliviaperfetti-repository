## Further user feedback

Since my last draft, I was able to get feedback from another user, in addition to my TSWD professor and teaching assistant. 

### Here's the feedback from a middle-aged professional:

1. What is the main message you take away from this story?

> Fracking is an unsafe practice, is not a solution that helps with climate change problems, does not offer employement

2. Did you learn anything and/or change your opinions after viewing?

>I learned about the grand jury investigation, which I didn't know

3. Are you convinced that the story being told is correct? Did you feel there were any moments where I didn't provide enough evidence to back my claims?

>No. you have good citations. But there is not a good segue where you suddenly talk about the child in the bathtub ("meanwhile....") I think this should be moved to be part of the presentation where the child is in the sandbox. Also, what year is that? I think that slide needs to be restructured. The boxon scientific terms there should also be moved. The pic of the WPA counties needs more info like stars where the fracking sites are. Now it just seems like you are showing us the counties and I couldn't tie it into the narrative there. Or color it in and write "marcellus shale area."

4. What are you still confused about? (Either about the substance or from the data visualizations)

>"Later research would show that fracking produces about the same amount of global warming pollution as coal... if not more"BECAUSE IT EMITS METHANE, THOUGH NOT CO2

5. Were there any times that the language was difficult to understand or you noticed use of jargon?

>What is Ewing Sarcoma? What is lymphoma? What "kind" of cancer is it? Do people die from it? (I KNEW THIS BUT OTHERS MIGHT NOT)

6. What did you want to know more about after viewing?

>HOW DID PA FOLLOW UP AFTER THE GRAND JURY REPORT?

7. What, if anything, felt repetitive or irrelevant?

>no, just the one part out of order (bathtub boy)

8. Any other feedback or changes you'd suggest?

>little more attention to segue

### This was fairly consistent with the feedback I received from my professor and teaching assistant, which followed the following themes:

- Make sure to back up with research
- Change the title
- Transition better with direct quotes
- Consistent color palatte
- Titles that tell a story

## Changes I made since the last draft

### Title and color palatte

I changed the title so that the user would not be left wondering about the link to cancer until much later in the presentation. It was really hard to think of something, and eventually I decided to keep it simple. I changed more of the photos to be black and white, and I changed some type color to orange. I am hoping this tied the color scheme together better, and also made some statistics and titles stand out.

### Coherence and transitions

I updated some of my graph titles to tell a better story. For some reason, I could never figure out how to make the title of my GIS map show. But I'm hoping the preceding sentence gives the user some context.

I added dates to some of the sections so that the user could get a picture for how the story is moving through time.

I added a sentence to remind the user to press the play button on the map, in response to feedback from User 2.

### Content

I added an image card explaining the way-- in scientific terms-- that fracking can contaminate water. This was in response to my first user feedback session. I am hoping that with the image card, a user can choose to scroll past this information if they already have a sense of how that would happen.

I changed some phrasing to use less dramatic language and make sure my statements were backed by evidence. For example, I changed "state agencies were complicit in allowing companies to get away with fracking crimes" to "failed to properly oversee the oil and gas industry and respond adequately to residents' concerns." I also added that the Pitt study did not find an association between exposure to fracking and Ewing Sarcoma.

I added some more content on potential health problems linked to fracking, including another preliminary study, and more information on Ewing's and Lymphoma (at the request of both users).

I added another data visualization showing sources of natural gas systems in the U.S. I had wanted to show U.S. methane emissions over time, but I felt it would have been a jump to attribute any overall rises in methane emissions to fracking specifically (I had a hard time finding more specific data on that). So, instead, I'm hoping this viz gives some helpful context on the role of natural gas production in overall methane pollution.

Finally, I wanted to get at the other side of the issue, which is typically job creation. So I added a section on a study finding that fracking brought much fewer jobs than anticipated. I waffled about whether this would be off-topic, but ultimately decided that given the context of this region (companies often setting up shop and promising to heal our post-industrial wounds), it would be good to include.

### Citations and sources

I changed out some images to ensure that they were licensed for reuse with attribution. I also added more in-text citations and a list of references at the end.

### Easy fixes

I re-embedded the first graph, Gas production, to the chart view so that the viewer wouldn't need to click through.

I added a link to a community group doing good work on this issue in the call to action.
