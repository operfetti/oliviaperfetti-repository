# My final project (the final version)

## Further user feedback

Since my last draft, I was able to get feedback from another user, in addition to my TSWD professor. Here's the feedback from a middle-aged professional:

1. What is the main message you take away from this story?

> Fracking is an unsafe practice, is not a solution that helps with climate change problems, does not offer employement

2. Did you learn anything and/or change your opinions after viewing?

I learned about the grand jury investigation, which I didn't know

3. Are you convinced that the story being told is correct? Did you feel there were any moments where I didn't provide enough evidence to back my claims?

No. you have good citations. But there is not a good segue where you suddenly talk about the child in the bathtub ("meanwhile....") I think this should be moved to be part of the presentation where the child is in the sandbox. Also, what year is that? I think that slide needs to be restructured. The boxon scientific terms there should also be moved. The pic of the WPA counties needs more info like stars where the fracking sites are. Now it just seems like you are showing us the counties and I couldn't tie it into the narrative there. Or color it in and write "marcellus shale area."


4. What are you still confused about? (Either about the substance or from the data visualizations)

"Later research would show that fracking produces about the same amount of global warming pollution as coal... if not more"BECAUSE IT EMITS METHANE, THOUGH NOT CO2

5. Were there any times that the language was difficult to understand or you noticed use of jargon?

What is Ewing Sarcoma? What is lymphoma? What "kind" of cancer is it? Do people die from it? (I KNEW THIS BUT OTHERS MIGHT NOT)

6. What did you want to know more about after viewing?

HOW DID PA FOLLOW UP AFTER THE GRAND JURY REPORT?

7. What, if anything, felt repetitive or irrelevant?

no, just the one part out of order (bathtub boy)

8. Any other feedback or changes you'd suggest?
 little more attention to segue
