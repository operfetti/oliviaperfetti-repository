# Reimagining the Climate Action Tracker

I chose to critique a Climate Action Tracker visualization because I believe that climate change is one of the most urgent problems facing our global community, and the United States has had an outsized impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, scientists have done a bad job of imparting information about climate change to the general public. The visualization can be found at https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/

## Here is the original Climate Action Tracker:

## My critique

I evaluated the visualization using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile (Perceptual Edge, 2017). Few recommends using seven criteria: First, is it informative? (Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness). Second, is it emotive? (Aesthetics, Engagement)

 Here were some of my initial thoughts:

### Visualization 1 (Global Map)
This visualization is effective in showing a fairly simple country-to-country comparison. Based on the colors and scale, you can pretty easily see how any one country is doing compared to others (except for much of Africa, parts of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, etc. for which there appears to be no data).

But after first glance, I was left wondering how these countries were ranked. Is it by overall GHG emissions, or policies in place to reduce emissions? I clicked on the U.S. > View Full Country profile. 

### Visualization 2 (Country Profile)
The country profile visualization is much more confusing. First, most of the language throughout is filled with jargon and difficult to understand. Second, there are too many components, words, icons and colors pulling my attention. To actually interpret the data, I had to click through multiple explanations. (What is the difference between "modelled domestic pathway" and "fair share"? What is the "NDC target"?) Overall, I shouldn't need to click a button that says "how to read graph" in order to read the graph. This is why I ranked the visualization low for "perceptibility" and "intuitiveness."

The visualization does have some strengths. It seems to be accurate (all the raw data is included and appears credible) and it draws the audience in to engage with the subject further (I read through the whole overview below and found it very interesting). This is why I ranked it highly for "truthfulness" and "engagement."

The other categories I ranked in the middle range. The landing page/country comparison visualization had pretty good usefulness and aesthetics, but the country summary could be improved in these categories. On the other hand, the country comparison felt incomplete and while the country summary was complete with the missing information (if you can understand it!).

### Who is the audience?

Because of the complexity of the visualization and how many details were included, I imagine that the primary audience for this tool is policymakers, and a secondary audience might be climate activists/advocates around the world. The tool could be effective for a subset of this audience (EPA data analysts) but ineffective for others (young activists/ those without advanced degrees or expertise in climate policy.) Also, I was unable to find a way to translate to another language, so it is unclear whether a non-English speaker would find this useful (especially with all the technical terms).

### Suggestions

For Visualization 1 (Global Map), my suggestions are to:
(1) Make the language "1.5 C Paris Agreement Compatible" simpler
(2) Change the color scale so that the "critically insufficient" category is a dark red (signifying the "worst" level-- right now the dark gray seems like there could be no data for those countries)
(3) Explain what "Assessments of Aviation/Shipping" means

For Visualization 2 (Country Profile), the most important things are to:
(1) Simplify all the language
(2) Focus on just one of either "modelled domestic pathways" or "fair share" (the audience could scroll to see the other one, but it's too much to see at once)

### Final thoughts
Overall, I think that Few's critique method was helpful for evaluating the data visualization. One measure that might not be captured in this method is what does the audience do with this information afterwards? For example, it might be helpful to include information in the overview on how to take action (calling elected officials, etc.)

## My initial revision

Here's my first stab at a revised visualization for the Country Profile for USA:

![image](https://github.com/operfetti/oliviaperfetti-repository/assets/157427926/72bc98c5-aff9-46be-84a7-bfbb9ec9d926)

I started by making a list of the bare minimum of things that I wanted to keep in the visualization. These were the overall message (USA insufficient/ not doing enough on climate change) and the 4 categories showing different pathways. I also wanted to include the information necessary to make it complete without crowding the visualization with too many words.

Next, I got some helpful feedback from two friends. Here they are:

### Feedback 1: Brought to you by a 25 year old young professional with expertise in public policy.

**- Can you tell me your main takeaway from this graph?**
The U.S. needs to take new and drastic action regarding its emission rate to alter the trajectory of climate change.

**- Where was your eye drawn first in this graph?**
My eye was first drawn to the four colored lines in the forked pattern at the end of the graph.

**- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?**
Given historical records of mild decreases over time, I find it surprising that post-2023, business as usual would cause a drastic increase in emissions. Additionally, I'm surprised at the relatively small amount of (might not be the right term?) emissions needed to set the U.S. on track to 'undo' past emissions.
(Note from me: Because the original visualization was so difficult to understand, I'm not entirely sure that I replicated it properly-- so take this with a grain of salt)

**- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?**
Because of a lack of definitions, I would imagine that the intended audience for this graph is people who are already familiar with climate change and have an interest in taking action against high emissions. For example, a layperson may not know the "1.5 degree C goal" or the Paris Climate Accords. 

**- Is there anything you would change or do differently?**
If the audience is, in fact, laypeople, I would add brief descriptions of climate-specific terms as outlined in the previous question. Additionally, as a viewer, I am curious about what normal/healthy levels of emissions are; I know the historical data doesn't capture this, as the U.S. has always been a big polluter. That said, comparative data to other countries, for example, could be too much information in one visualization. I love the way you have represented the data as is!

### Feedback 2: Brought to you by a middle-aged, highly educated professional-- but one with little policy expertise.
**- Can you tell me your main takeaway from this graph?**
Action is needed to reduce emissions, and one can compare outcomes based on different actions.

**- Where was your eye drawn first in this graph?**
Y axis to see what we are measuring.

**- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?**
I am not sure what the "Mt" is in "MtCo2e" per year. I also note the space on your X-axis between 1990-2023 and 2023-2030 is not consistent. I htink you indicated this with the dotted line but I believe the usual notation is two slashed lines along the X-axis. I could be wrong about that.

**- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?**
Anyone interested in climate change who can read a graph.

**- Is there anything you would change or do differently?**
I don't like having to click on a quesiton mark. I would label the lines in different colors or numbers and just put the explanaiton below. You sort of did that but didn't actually label the lines #'s 1-4. However, it was easy to understand anyway.

## My proposed revised version

A few thought I had from that feedback: It seems like the message I want to send is getting through. It also seems like the places in the graph drawing attention are (1) the upper left quadrant, which is where the y-axis label is, and (2) the colorful part of the chart. That's mostly a good thing, but I also want to draw attention to the title, which tells a better story than the y-axis. I think it would help to take out the "MtCo2e" which seems confusing. I agree with the suggestion of making the X-axis more accurately reflect time.

I'm not sure whether to implement the feedback concerning including the descriptions as explanations, instead of having them as (?) icons that you can hover over. I am reluctant to crowd with text, but I agree that making the viewer hover could just add more work-- or it could be hard to understand.

The hardest part is striking a balance of including information that might be interesting (normal/healthy emissions levels, and info on the Paris Climate Accords) versus what's necessary to understand the core message. In this case, I think I would opt for including some of this extra information in the overview.
