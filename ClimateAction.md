# Reimagining the Climate Action Tracker

I chose to critique a Climate Action Tracker visualization because I believe that climate change is one of the most urgent problems facing our global community, and the United States has had an outsized impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, scientists have done a bad job of imparting information about climate change to the general public. The visualization can be found at https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/usa/

## Here is the original Climate Action Tracker:

## My critique

I evaluated the visualization using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile (Perceptual Edge, 2017). Few recommends using seven criteria: 

Is it informative?
 • Usefulness
 • Completeness
 • Perceptibility
 • Truthfulness
 • Intuitiveness

Is it emotive?
 • Aesthetics
 • Engagement

 Here were some of my initial thoughts:

### Visualization 1 (Global Map)
This visualization is effective in showing a fairly simple country-to-country comparison. Based on the colors and scale, you can pretty easily see how any one country is doing compared to others (except for much of Africa, parts of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, etc. for which there appears to be no data).

But after first glance, I was left wondering how these countries were ranked. Is it by overall GHG emissions, or policies in place to reduce emissions? I clicked on the U.S. > View Full Country profile. The country profile visualization is much more confusing. First, most of the language throughout is filled with jargon and difficult to understand. Second, there are too many components, words, icons and colors pulling my attention. To actually interpret the data, I had to click through multiple explanations. (What is the difference between "modelled domestic pathway" and "fair share"? What is the "NDC target"?) Overall, I shouldn't need to click a button that says "how to read graph" in order to read the graph. This is why I ranked the visualization low for "perceptibility" and "intuitiveness."

The visualization does have some strengths. It seems to be accurate (all the raw data is included and appears credible) and it draws the audience in to engage with the subject further (I read through the whole overview below and found it very interesting). This is why I ranked it highly for "truthfulness" and "engagement."

The other categories I ranked in the middle range. The landing page/country comparison visualization had pretty good usefulness and aesthetics, but the country summary could be improved in these categories. On the other hand, the country comparison felt incomplete and while the country summary was complete with the missing information (if you can understand it!).
