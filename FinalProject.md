# Final Project Part I

## Outline

### _Summary_
For my final project, I want to tell the story of fracking in Southwestern Pennsylvania– in particular its harm to our health and climate. Since the “fracking boom” in 2005-2007, hundreds of thousands unconventional (fracking) wells have been drilled in the region, which have racked up more than 70,000 violations.  In 2020, former Attorney General Josh Shapiro issued a Grand Jury report that uncovered systematic failure by Pennsylvania government agencies in overseeing the fracking industry and protecting residents from industry operations. Concerns over the health impacts of fracking have continued to increase. More recently, the University of Pittsburgh released a study examining a possible link between fracking and a cluster of childhood cancer cases in SWPA. The researchers found moderate evidence that overall unconventional natural gas drilling (UNGD) is associated with childhood lymphoma.

### _Story Structure_

Set-up: 
- Fracking was hailed as a cleaner energy source– and as a solution to climate change and air pollution
- Show growth in wells from first few years
- Meanwhile: Man in Washington County gives his 3-year-old son a bath. The son emerges from the bathtub with chemical-grade burns

Conflict:
- Describe growing evidence linking fracking to health problems (Pitt study)
- Show growing number of wells in PA (until present year)
- Show # of violations at wells
- Show Grand Jury report

Resolution:
- But will it solve climate change?
- Show increase in nationwide methane emissions
- Studies showing equal if not greater climate impact to coal-fired power plants
- (Possibly: Add polling showing support for fracking is decreasing?)
- Add success stories of local communities who have shut down proposed fracking

Call to action:
- Support renewable energy (wind and solar)
- Contact your elected officials to call for action on climate change
- Call for statewide ban on fracking

## Data

### _Raw data_
- Number of unconventional oil & gas wells in Pennsylvania: [PA Department of Environmental Protection]([url](https://newdata-padep-1.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/68f5c539)). I plan to use this data to show the number of fracking wells drilled in SWPA at various stages of time, using a map / point feature visualization.
- Number of fracking well violations since 2008 in Pennsylvania: [PA Dataset by FracTracker Alliance]([url](https://carnegiemellon.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id)). I plan to use this data to create a simple line graph in Tableau showing the number of violations at fracking wells as one color-highlighted line and the number of fracking wells drilled as a background/gray line– most likely from 2008 to 2023.

### _News sources_

I plan to use these mainly as attention grabbers to show the audience what types of stories have been in the mainstream and what kind of concerns residents have. For each, I would include a brief write-up in the side pane giving the highlights of the news story.
- [43rd Statewide Grand Jury Finds Pennsylvania Failed To Protect Citizens During Fracking Boom – PA Office of Attorney General]([url](https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/43rd-statewid))
- [A Pennsylvania study suggests links between fracking and asthma, lymphoma in children | AP News]([url](https://apnews.com/article/fracking-pennsylvania-health-environm))
- [New Investigation Finds Fracking Chemicals in the Bodies of People in Southwestern Pa.]([url](https://www.alleghenyfront.org/new-investigation-finds-exposure)) - The Allegheny Front

### _Possible Media Sources_
I am hoping to include a few public-domain/ copyright free images such as the one below from Openverse. Ideally, I would love to include a clip from the documentary “Gasland” but I need to investigate whether that is possible.
- [Bernice 1 and 2 wells with moisture flare - Evanson Place - Arnegard North Dakota - 2013-07-04 | Openverse]([url](https://openverse.org/image/68429da6-1cbb-4d0a-9307-80c40))
- (See about rights to Gasland clip)

## Method and medium
I am probably going to use a combination of Shorthand and Tableau. I may also use ArcGIS for the well data maps, or embed the source directly into Shorthand if that is possible.
That said– I think it would be possible to use ArcGIS Story Maps instead, so I would love any advice/feedback on the tradeoffs between the platforms!
