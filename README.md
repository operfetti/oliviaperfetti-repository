This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU.

## About me
Hey! I'm Liv and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College studying public policy and management. I grew up in Pittsburgh, and from a young age I was motivated to solve the region’s environmental problems– in particular air pollution. I studied environmental science at the University of Michigan and spent a year as an environmental organizer in-training with Green Corps. I returned to Pittsburgh in 2020 to work for the advocacy group PennEnvironment, where I helped advance legislation to protect Allegheny County parks from fracking and ban plastic bags in Pittsburgh. I have also worked in several local government offices, including Pennsylvania’s 21st legislative district in Lawrenceville and Pittsburgh’s Council District 8 office, and canvassed for local political campaigns. Outside of school and work, I love to bike, explore Pittsburgh's many neighborhoods and seek sunlight wherever possible.

## What I hope to learn
I've never used Markdown before! This is already a great learning experience. Additionally, I have always felt that we need to make science and policy more accessible to the general public. To that end, in my own career I want to be able to display data in a way that is easily understood. Beyond that, I think color theory is fascinating and I should probably learn Tableau.

After I graduate, I'm interested in working in local government (Allegheny County or the City of Pittsburgh) to advance stronger environmental policies.
